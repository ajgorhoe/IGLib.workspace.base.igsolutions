This is to temporarily store VS solutions that were located in the containing
directory before a larger refactoring started.

These solutions are just kept temporarily so that one can lookup which 
projects were included in them and how thez were arranged in solution 
directories.

The only solution that remained used during refactoring is 
  ../ShellDevAll.sln
This solution contains a larger subser of projects that are currently used.

Reduced solutions may be derived from that one when refactoring is finished
(or maybe not) and will probably not be derived from the old versions contained in this directory (which may be difficult because of changes in directory structure).

When not needed any more, these old copies should be removed.
