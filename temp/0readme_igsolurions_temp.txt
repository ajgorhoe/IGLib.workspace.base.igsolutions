This is to temporarily store VS solutions that were located in the containing
directory before a larger refactoring started.

These solutions are just kept temporarily so that one can lookup which 
projects were included in them and how thez were arranged in solution 
directories.

The only solution that remained used during refactoring is 
  ../ShellDevAll.sln
Reduced solutions will be derived from that one when refacttoring is finished
(or maybe not) and will neot be derived from the old versions contained in
this directory (which may be difficult because of changes in directory
structure).

When not needed anz more, these old copies should be removed.
