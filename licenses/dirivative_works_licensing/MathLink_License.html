    <para>Your Mathematica License Agreement governs the use of the
      software known as the MathLink Libraries. This addendum serves to
      extend your Mathematica License Agreement to allow you to create
      and use certain derivative works that contain MathLink Libraries.<br>
      <br>
      A MathLink-containing derivative work ("Derivative") is software
      that statically links with or dynamically loads one or more
      MathLink libraries or resource files, or which is derived from
      code created by using the mprep program. <br>
      <br>
      You are allowed to create Derivatives. This license does not allow
      you to distribute a Derivative for any commercial purpose without
      written permission from Wolfram Research, Inc. (See last section
      for information on requesting alternative licenses.) There may be
      a nominal charge when the Derivative is distributed to be used in
      conjunction with Mathematica. MathLink Libraries can also be
      licensed from Wolfram Research, Inc. for use and distribution
      without Mathematica. Any Derivative that you create must include
      the following copyright notice in a prominent location:<br>
      <br>
    </para>
    <div align="center"><para>Portions copyright 2002 Wolfram Research,
        Inc.</para><br>
      <para></para></div>
    <para><br>
      The year(s) stated in the copyright notice must match the years
      stated in the copyright notice for the MathLink library or
      resource file(s) incorporated into the Derivative. A prominent
      location is defined as the startup screen or an "About Box" of the
      Derivative.<br>
      <br>
      Derivatives may be used when, during the majority of the period of
      their operation, they are used in conjunction with Mathematica
      (i.e., the MathLink capabilities of the Derivative are used for
      the purpose of communicating with Mathematica). In addition,
      Derivatives may be used for a purpose other than communicating
      with Mathematica when the Derivatives are in use on a computer
      that is licensed to operate a version of Mathematica that has a
      version number (as defined in the Mathematica License Certificate)
      that is equal to or greater than the version number specified on
      the Mathematica License Certificate associated with this
      Mathematica License Agreement.<br>
      <br>
      If you wish to distribute a Derivative for commercial purposes,
      you should contact Wolfram Research. Please write to us at the
